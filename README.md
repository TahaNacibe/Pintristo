# Pintristo

Pintristo is a full clone of Pinterest built in Flutter using Firebase for backend services. It was created as a hands-on portfolio project to push the limits of what can be achieved with Flutter and Firebase, focusing on replicating key Pinterest features such as pin creation, collections, real-time updates, and interactive UI. The project also serves as a personal learning experiment, exploring responsive layouts, state management, and integration with Firebase Cloud Storage for image handling. While not intended for production use, it demonstrates practical application development and provides a robust template for building complex, native-like Flutter apps.
